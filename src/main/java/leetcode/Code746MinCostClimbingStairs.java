 * @Description: You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase.
 * <p>
 * Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
 * <p>
 * You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: cost = [10,15,20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: You will start at index 1.
 * - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
 * The total cost is 15.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: You will start at index 0.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
 * - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
 * - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
 * The total cost is 6.
